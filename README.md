# Time and Space Complexity for CamelCase
# Time comeplxity:
the time complexity of the code is O(n). This is because the code is checking each letter to see if it is capital or not. Because of this the run time increases linerarly for the size of the inpute string 

# Space complexity:
Input String: The input string 's' is stored in memory, which takes O(n) space, where 'n' is the length of the input string.
Variables: The code uses a few integer variables ('Count' and 'result') and character variables ('c' in the loop), which take constant space O(1).
the space complexity of the code is O(n) due to the storage of the input string.

# Time and Space Complexity for Correctness and the Loop Invariant
# Time Complexity:
the time complexity of the code is dominated by the Insertion Sort algorithm used in it. because of this the time complexity would be O(n^2) as that is the runtime of Insertion Sort

# Space Complexity:
Input Array: The integer array 'ar' of size 'n' takes O(n) space in memory to store the input data.
Variables: The code uses integer variables 'n', 'i', 'value', and 'j', which take constant space O(1).
the space complexity of the code is O(n) due to the storage of the input array.
